Purpose: <implement and compare series of tree implementaions.>

Files in project: 

    BinarySearchTree.java
    BinarySearchTest.java
    BTree.java
    BTreeTest.java
    TreeProfiler.java
    TwoFourTree.java 
    TwoFourTest.java           
    DSAQueue.java
    TreeIo.java
    stocksClass.java 

Test Files: <2019.txt, 20190218.txt)>

Functionality: 
    when the program starts in interactive mode, is displays a menu
    with functionality load data, find, insert, delete, stats, save. if no command 
    line argument it prints usage. else in profile mode, the user should be allowed
    to choose the tree, size of tree and input file within command line.

    binary, text and serialised functionality is avalible withing the UI and 
    are depended on the TreeIo


TODO: < delete function has not been implemented in 243 and Btree as well as balance > 
    additional statistic is also required:

Known bugs
	bug#_<1>: <can't read serialised data from txt file>
    How to replicate: <after serialising a text file load that serialsed file>
    how to fix: <test another serailised file to determin if the fault is within
                the load or the save>
    bug#_<2>: cant read binary data
